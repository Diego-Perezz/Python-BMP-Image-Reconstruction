# # Python BMP Image Reconstruction

This Python project explores problem decomposition, system design, data structures, and testing through a jungle-themed adventure. Key challenges include decoding a secret message using a Caesar cipher, fixing code logic, optimizing a virtual raft for river crossing, and reconstructing a shredded BMP image based on pixel similarity.

## Summary
- Decrypted a secret message using Caesar cipher logic.
- Debugged and optimized items in the virtual pack.
- Adjusted raft dimensions to solve a river crossing problem.
- Reconstructed a shredded BMP image from horizontal strips using custom similarity logic.
